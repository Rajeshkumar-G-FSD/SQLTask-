-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;

-- Use the newly created database
USE ecommerce;

-- Create the customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    address TEXT
);

-- Create the products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

-- Insert sample data into customers table
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, address)
VALUES 
('John Doe', 'john@example.com', '123 Elm Street'),
('Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', '456 Maple Avenue'),
('Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', '789 Oak Drive');

-- Insert sample data into products table
INSERT INTO products (name, price, description)
VALUES 
('Product A', 25.00, 'Description of Product A'),
('Product B', 30.00, 'Description of Product B'),
('Product C', 40.00, 'Description of Product C');

-- Insert sample data into orders table
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
VALUES 
(1, '2025-01-10', 100.00),
(2, '2025-01-20', 150.00),
(3, '2025-01-25', 200.00);

-- 1. Retrieve all customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days
SELECT DISTINCT c.*
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;

-- 2. Get the total amount of all orders placed by each customer
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id;

-- 3. Update the price of Product C to 45.00
UPDATE products
SET price = 45.00
WHERE name = 'Product C';

-- 4. Add a new column discount to the products table
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN discount DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0.00;

-- 5. Retrieve the top 3 products with the highest price
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- 6. Get the names of customers who have ordered Product A
SELECT DISTINCT c.name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.name = 'Product A';

-- 7. Join the orders and customers tables to retrieve the customer's name and order date for each order
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

-- 8. Retrieve the orders with a total amount greater than 150.00
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amount > 150.00;

-- 9. Normalize the database by creating a separate table for order items
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),

-- Add sample data for the normalized structure
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity)
VALUES 
(1, 1, 2),
(2, 2, 3),
(3, 3, 4);

-- 10. Retrieve the average total of all orders
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_order_total
FROM orders;
